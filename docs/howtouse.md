## One Time Setup

Install pyenv using homebrew to keep multiple versions of isolated python virtual environments
```console
brew install pyenv
```

Install the latest version of Python.  At the time of writing this was 3.10.6.  If something stops working update this doc with the specfic version that needs to be used.
```console
pyenv install 3.10.6
```

Install pyenv-virtualenv
```console
brew install pyenv-virtualenv
```
